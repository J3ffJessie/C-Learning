# What is this Repo?

This repository is going to house all the random learnings that I go through as I start learning C# and progress into .Net and beyond to learn new skills in a different language than just JavaScript.

Nothing fancy, just a single repo that houses all the different learnings as I go through different things and try to learn the basics of C# and .NET and all the inner workings in my free time and dive deeper into understanding different languages and how projects work.
